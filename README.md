# Hello, I am Flokshi :)

A random wannabe-* kiddo, that is cronically online, so I probably have heared of 90% of topics that are trending. 
Likes computers in the sence that i like to open them up and see their inner structure, to understand how they works and to pook it with a stick, yeah kinda like reversing. Still not smart enough for reversing though. Mostly of my works are here, and mostly will be public, since I am a strong believer of open source. 
Mostly interested on social engineering, find it super cool. (AND YES I HAVE OFCOURSE READ : The Ghost in the Wires - by Kevin Mitnick)

Just a random computer lover, nothing more. 
Hope you have a nice journey :)
